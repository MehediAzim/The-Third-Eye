#  The Third-Eye: A video Based Helping Aid for Dementia Patients

### Abstract

This research shows the path for developing an activity reminder which can be used as a replacement of caregivers for dementia patients. By monitoring a person's daily activity for a few days our model will be able to predict a person's next day's activities and if the person misses any predicted activity at a given time our model will notify the user. Although our model got a staggering accuracy of 98.95\% in predicting activity recognition the result falls drastically when implementing in the application due to the data variations of the collected pre-trained model and the user devices. Since no work has been done before acknowledging this problem our research opens a new door for real-time activity recognition from video data for creating activity reminder models.
